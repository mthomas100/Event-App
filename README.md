ðŸ›‘ *This project is a work in progress, but feel free to check out the progress made so far!* 

### Instructions for running project locally

Prerequisites:

- The [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/) must be installed on your system
- You must have access to the [SeatGeek API](https://seatgeek.com/build)

Steps:

1) Clone Repository
2) Install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn`
3) Create a `.env` file with the following Key/Value pairs:
```
REACT_APP_SEATGEEK_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_SEATGEEK_CLIENT_ID>
REACT_APP_SEATGEEK_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR_SEATGEEK_CLEINT_SECRET>
```
4) Run project with `yarn start` or `npm run start`
5) Follow instructions given in the terminal by the Expo CLI to access the application 


### Current Features

- A screen providing the ability to explore venues in the city of a users choosing. A screen for these venues and a list of events and their dates which will be happening at that venue. 

- This application pulls in event data from the [SeatGeek API](https://seatgeek.com/build). 
In order to utilize the API without a need for consulting its documentation, the [types for all possible query responses and all possible input parameters](https://github.com/mthomas100/Event-App/tree/master/types) were written. Creating these types was merely involved a Postman GET request to the various API endpoints and pasting of the JSON results obtained there into the [MakeTypes Generator](https://jvilk.com/MakeTypes/)

- A custom hook called [useSeatGeekQuery](https://github.com/mthomas100/Event-App/blob/master/hooks/useSeatGeekQuery.tsx) 
that takes the arguments of resource and params in order to query the API effectively. 

- Combining types for the API and the useSeatGeekQuery which allows for rapid and type safe building of the application while maximizing the potential out of the SeatGeek API.

- Persistence of redux store from previous sessions through usage of the [redux-persist](https://github.com/mthomas100/Event-App/blob/master/hooks/useSeatGeekQuery.tsx) library. Implementation can be seen in [redux/index.ts](https://github.com/mthomas100/Event-App/blob/master/redux/index.ts) and [App.tsx](https://github.com/mthomas100/Event-App/blob/master/App.tsx)

- Data request via [useSeatGeekQuery](https://github.com/mthomas100/Event-App/blob/master/hooks/useSeatGeekQuery.tsx) will first check to see if data has been fetched previously (aka: is found in the redux store). If is in the redux store already, the data will not be wastefully fetched again.
